# UniControl-Wireless-USB-Controller-for-Multiple-Consoles

UniControl is an ambitious project aimed at developing a wireless system that enables the use of a single USB controller across multiple gaming consoles. By leveraging the power of ESP32 microcontrollers and WiFi technology, this project aims to transmit USB controller data wirelessly, eliminating the need for wired connections and providing a seamless, unified gaming experience.

The primary goals of UniControl include:

Achieve low-latency wireless transmission of USB data packets between ESP32 microcontrollers, ensuring lossless and real-time controller input.
Integrate support for various gaming consoles, including (but not limited to) Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and others that accept USB controllers.
Implement console-specific input translation to ensure compatibility with each platform's controller protocols.
Incorporate voice activation capabilities, allowing users to control and power on/off consoles using voice commands.
Develop a user-friendly interface for managing console switching and providing a seamless gaming experience across multiple platforms.
UniControl is an ambitious project that combines wireless communication, microcontroller programming, console modding, and user experience design. It offers a unique solution for gamers seeking a unified and convenient way to control their gaming setups, eliminating the need for multiple controllers and wired connections.

This repository serves as the central hub for the UniControl project, housing the code, documentation, and resources necessary for its development and implementation. Collaboration and contributions from the community are welcome, as we strive to create a truly cross-platform, wireless gaming experience.
